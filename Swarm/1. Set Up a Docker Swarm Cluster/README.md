# Objective: Set Up a Docker Swarm Cluster

**Tasks**:
    1. Initialize a cluster of Docker Engines in swarm
    2. Add nodes to the Swarm
    3. Deploy application services to the Swarm
    4. Manage the Swarm once you have everything running

1. ## Initialize a cluster of Docker Engines in swarm

    To demostrate I'll need 3 Linux Hosts each having Docker installed and will communicate over a network. For this task, I'll be using Canonical's Multipass to create Ubuntu VMs (Virtual Machines).

    Using **Multipass**, I have created 3 VMs as shown below:
